Package: fixedincome
Title: Tools for fixed income mathematics
Description: fixedincome has a set of funtions which helps with the
    mathematics of interest rates. It handles the interest rates and compounding
    factors as objects and provides a bunch of methods to tackle specific issues
    like compute discount factors, find equivalent rates and forward rates,
    and so on. It also has a class which represents a term structure of interest
    rates and a sort of methods to execute simple tasks, like interpolation.
